# ML engineering & Tools

## This repository gives an overview of all the necessary tools and technologies needed to become an ML/MLOps engineer.

The ML components are as follows:

1. Data source
2. Data pre-processing
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Model deployment
6. Model monitoringg 

To automate the operations of the above six components, you will need the following:

1. A data engineering pipeline that converts raw data into high quality data.
2. A machine learning pipeline that builds the model and deploys it into production.
3. A trigger mechanism to rerun the pipeline incase data quality falls below a pre-defined frequency.
